Four of the most basic structures: stacks, binary search trees, and priority queues

Stack: save info that will need to be processed later. "last-in, first-out" (LIFO)
"An analogy to this is a stack of books on a desk: a new book is placed on the top of the stack (pushed) and a book is removed from the top also (popped)"

Queue: Process items in the order in which requests are generated. "first-in, first-out" (FIFO)
"operate just like stacks, except items are removed from the bottom instead of the top"

Binary search tree: When storing items needs to be able to efficiently process the operations of insertion, deletion, and query
