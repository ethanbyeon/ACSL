AND: xy or x * y
OR: x + y
NOT: x¯¯¯ or ¬x
XOR: x ⊕ y = xy¯¯¯ + x¯¯¯y
XNOR: True whenever the values are the same (the not of the xor function). x ⊙ y = x ⊕ y¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ or x ⊙ y = xy + x¯¯¯y

Order of Precedence
NOT > AND > XOR > XNOR > OR

Fundamental Identities
Commutative Law: x + y = y + x, x ⋅ y = y ⋅ x
Associative Law: (x + y) + z = x + (y + z), (x + y) + z = x +(y + z)
Idempotent Law: x + x = x, x ⋅ x = x
Annihilator Law: x + 1 = 1, x ⋅ 0 = 0
Identity Law: x + 0 = x, x ⋅ 1 = x
Complement Law: x + x¯¯¯ = 1, x ⋅ x¯¯¯ = 0
Absorptive Law: x + xy = x, x + x¯¯¯y = x + y, x(x + y) = x
Distributive Law: x ⋅ (y + z) = xy + xz, (x + y) ⋅ (p + q) = xp + xq + yp + yq, (x + y)(x + z) = x + yz
DeMorgan's Law: x + y¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ = x¯¯¯ ⋅ y¯¯¯, x ⋅ y¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ = x¯¯¯ + y¯¯¯
Double Negation: x¯¯¯¯¯¯ = x
