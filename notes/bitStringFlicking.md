Bit strings: strings of binary digits that are manipulated bit-by-bit using logical operators

Bit strings are often used to maintain a set where values are either in the set or not.

Bitwise Operators
NOT, AND, OR, XOR

Shift Operators
Logical shifts the bit-string x positions in the indicated direction
Bits shifted out are lost; zeros are shifted in at the other end

circulates: As each bit is shifted out one end, it is shifted in at the other end.

Order of Precedence (Highest to Lowest)
NOT > SHIFT > CIRC > AND > XOR > OR
